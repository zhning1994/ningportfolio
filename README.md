## Purpose of Project

This portfolio has listed down the project that I have completed in past, and also showcasing my skills and knowledge in development. There are many things I want to explore in future such as Figma, blockchain, Three.js, I have wrote down my future plan of what I am going to study in my portfolio as a to-do list. I have attaced the contact form in my portfolio, whoever want to have a conversation, collaboration or hired me to work can contact me via the form. 

Portfolio is build by React.js. I am facing the issue of SEO, Google can't indexing my portfolio page. I would like to rebuild my portfolio with Next.js in future. Next.js generate HTML of each pages in advance before being rendered by browser, therefore web crawler can index all pages. But this is still a good experience for me to build up this portfolio, I have tried the framer motion package to make my page more interactive, smooth transition between pages. 

Emailjs has been used as emails services for my portfolio site. User also can view my LinkedIn, Github and Facebook from the links inside portfolio. I am so appreciate who is willing to spend their time on viewing my projects. Feel free for contact me or chat with me, I am open to any opportunities.
